# Recognition-and-Segmentation-in-Anime-Eyes

## Introduction
Our repo consists of two Jupiter notebook (yolov8 + SAM, grounding dino + SAM). Users can run them separately to do anime characters' eyes detection and segmentation.

## Run 
Both of them are required to bind the data folder to the project root. 

In Dino Notebook, it asks the user to have a roboflow token to have the function to download the dataset from roboflow.com. 

In yolov8, the user needs to upload the zip file and unzip it, some path may need to be changed in case of running several times.
